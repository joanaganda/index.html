                                <div class="char-header">BETTY — The One Who Remembered</div>
                                <p>Betty’s love was quiet, observant, and deeply rooted. She noticed details—how James kicked rocks when he was nervous, how his laughter softened when he forgot to perform. Loving him felt natural, like gravity. She never questioned whether he loved her; she questioned whether he understood love at all.</p>
                                <p>Betty didn’t need constant reassurance. What she needed was consistency. She believed love was something you returned to every day, not something you chased when it felt exciting. That belief is what made James’s absence cut so deeply. He didn’t just leave—he broke the unspoken contract Betty thought they shared.</p>
                                <p>When James disappeared that summer, Betty didn’t fight. She waited. Not because she was weak, but because she trusted memory. She believed that what they had was too real to be replaced by novelty. Still, the waiting changed her. Love that waits learns how to harden without breaking.</p>
                                <p>By the time James came back, Betty was no longer the girl he left behind. She had learned that intuition doesn’t protect you from pain—it only prepares you to survive it.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">

                                <div class="char-header">JAMES — The One Who Ran</div>
                                <p>James loved Betty, but he didn’t understand her. He felt her steadiness as pressure, her certainty as expectation. Loving her meant becoming someone he wasn’t ready to be. So when things felt heavy, he fled—not out of malice, but fear.</p>
                                <p>James didn’t wake up planning to hurt anyone. He simply followed impulse. He wanted to feel wanted without responsibility. When he met the August girl, she offered him warmth without demand, affection without accountability. To James, it felt like freedom.</p>
                                <p>What he never understood was that freedom without honesty is still a lie. James told himself stories to justify his choices. He said he was young. He said it didn’t mean anything. He said he would fix it later. But “later” came with consequences he wasn’t prepared to face.</p>
                                <p>When summer ended, reality returned. And so did guilt. James’s apology wasn’t insincere—but it was incomplete. He wanted forgiveness without fully understanding what he broke.</p>

                                <div class="char-header"> AUGUST — The One Who Hoped</div>
                                <p>The August girl knew the truth from the beginning. She knew she wasn’t the first choice. She knew the love had an expiration date. But she chose to love anyway.</p>
                                <p>She didn’t fall for James because he promised her forever. She fell for him because he showed up. He looked at her like she mattered in the moment—and sometimes, the moment feels like enough. August is not naïve. She is willfully hopeful. She believes that love is worth the pain, even when it ends. She understands that being chosen temporarily still counts as being chosen at all.</p>
                                <p>When James left, she didn’t fight him. She didn’t blame Betty. Her grief was quiet and internalized. She mourned not just James, but the version of herself who thought she might be loved openly someday.</p>
                                <p>Her tragedy is not that she lost him—it’s that she never truly had him.</p>

                        <p>This love triangle isn’t about cheating—it’s about emotional imbalance.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Betty loved with depth and expectation</li>
                            <li>James loved with impulse and fear</li>
                            <li>August loved with awareness and hope</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>No one’s love was fake. But not all love is compatible. James’s greatest flaw was believing love should feel easy. The moment it became complicated, he assumed something was wrong. He didn’t understand that complexity is proof of emotional reality.</p>
                        <p>Betty’s strength became her wound. She loved someone who wasn’t equipped to love her back the same way. Her silence was mistaken for forgiveness before it was ever given.</p>
                        <p>August’s openness became her vulnerability. She accepted less because she believed love was scarce.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4 char-header">YEARS LATER — THE AFTERMATH</h4>
                        <p><strong>Betty:</strong> She becomes careful, not cold. She still loves deeply, but she no longer waits for people to choose her. The cardigan remains—a symbol of warmth she now gives only to those who stay.</p>
                        <p><strong>James:</strong> He grows older and finally understands what he lost. But realization doesn’t reverse time. His memory of Betty becomes a lesson, not a destination.</p>
                        <p><strong>August:</strong> She learns to demand more. The summer becomes a story she tells herself when she needs to remember she once loved bravely, even if foolishly.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4 char-header"> THE CORE TRAGEDY</h4>
                        <p>The heartbreak of this triangle isn’t betrayal—it’s timing and emotional readiness. They didn’t meet at the wrong time. <strong>They met at the right time to learn the wrong lessons.</strong></p>
